Automated Job Hunter
​Goal: To eliminate manual job searching and application message writing.
​Workflow Logic:
​Search: Uses SerpApi with a qdr:d (24-hour) filter to ensure only active, non-broken links are retrieved.
​Filtering: A custom JavaScript node cleans Google redirect URLs into direct job page links.
​AI Analysis: A dual AI Agent system (using Ollama/Gemini) compares the job snippet with my CV and GitHub portfolio to determine a "Match".
​Notification: Generates a human-like application message and sends it to Telegram if a match is found.
