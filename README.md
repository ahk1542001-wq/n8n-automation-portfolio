# 🚀 AI & Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my automation engineering portfolio! This repository serves as a monorepo containing various real-world automation projects I have built using n8n, Python, and AI Agents.

My goal is to solve everyday problems by connecting apps, automating repetitive tasks, and leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) for intelligent decision-making.
